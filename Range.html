<pre>

Line numbers may be specified with:		*:range* *E14* *{address}*
	{number}	an absolute line number
	.		the current line			  *:.*
	$		the last line in the file		  *:$*
	%		equal to 1,$ (the entire file)		  *:%*
	't		position of mark t (lowercase)		  *:'*
	'T		position of mark T (uppercase); when the mark is in
			another file it cannot be used in a range
	/{pattern}[/]	the next line where {pattern} matches	  *:/*
	?{pattern}[?]	the previous line where {pattern} matches *:?*
	\/		the next line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\?		the previous line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\&amp;		the next line where the previously used substitute
			pattern matches

Each may be followed (several times) by '+' or '-' and an optional number.
This number is added or subtracted from the preceding line number.  If the
number is omitted, 1 is used.

The "/" and "?" after {pattern} are required to separate the pattern from
anything that follows.

The "/" and "?" may be preceded with another address.  The search starts from
there.  The difference from using ';' is that the cursor isn't moved.
Examples: &gt;
	/pat1//pat2/	Find line containing "pat2" after line containing
			"pat1", without moving the cursor.
	7;/pat2/	Find line containing "pat2", after line 7, leaving
			the cursor in line 7.

The {number} must be between 0 and the number of lines in the file.  When
using a 0 (zero) this is interpreted as a 1 by most commands.  Commands that
use it as a count do use it as a zero (|:tag|, |:pop|, etc).  Some commands
interpret the zero as "before the first line" (|:read|, search pattern, etc).

Examples: &gt;
	.+3		three lines below the cursor
	/that/+1	the line below the next line containing "that"
	.,$		from current line until end of file
	0;/that		the first line containing "that", also matches in the
			first line.
	1;/that		the first line after line 1 containing "that"

Some commands allow for a count after the command.  This count is used as the
number of lines to be used, starting with the line given in the last line
specifier (the default is the cursor line).  The commands that accept a count
are the ones that use a range but do not have a file name argument (because
a file name can also be a number).

Examples: &gt;
	:s/x/X/g 5	substitute 'x' by 'X' in the current line and four
			following lines
	:23d 4		delete lines 23, 24, 25 and 26


Folds and Range

When folds are active the line numbers are rounded off to include the whole
closed fold.  See |fold-behavior|.


Reverse Range						*E493*

A range should have the lower line number first.  If this is not the case, Vim
will ask you if it should swap the line numbers.
	Backwards range given, OK to swap ~
This is not done within the global command ":g".

You can use ":silent" before a command to avoid the question, the range will
always be swapped then.


Count and Range						*N:*

When giving a count before entering ":", this is translated into:
		:.,.+(count - 1)
In words: The 'count' lines at and after the cursor.  Example: To delete
three lines: &gt;
		3:d&lt;CR&gt;		is translated into: .,.+2d&lt;CR&gt;
&lt;

Visual Mode and Range					*v_:*

{Visual}:	Starts a command-line with the Visual selected lines as a
		range.  The code ":'&lt;,'&gt;" is used for this range, which makes
		it possible to select a similar line from the command-line
		history for repeating a command on different Visually selected
		lines.
