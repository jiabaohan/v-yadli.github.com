<p>
Yeah I worry about this.<br />
</p>

<p>
More than 1 year ago I migrated from the wild to .Net, the managed
safehouse. I got very comfortable with C#, created a lot of stuff that
I could never do before.<br />
</p>

<p>
Talking about expressive power, I personally think C# is good.<br />
Talking about performance, it is also on par, or even significantly
outperforms with the major platforms. Except some of the native
languages. Especially after my effort to dismiss the boundary jumping
penalty between two worlds.<br />
</p>

<p>
But now, the question is, I'm lying safely in my comfort zone(and I'm
not going to get harmed if I don't stand up and do something),then why
bother jumping out? Isn't it good to enjoy what you have, and you are
good at, and focus on the things you can create? What is the ultimate
goal to acquire skills for new programming languages?<br />
</p>

<p>
Or sometimes it's not even new. I may want to take one step back and
look at the tools I once used, but now staying somewhere on my hard
drive, in my head, in a peaceful and sealed corner, rusted, and
covered with dust. Especially, for today(2013-04-17) I saw someone
building a quite decent indy game with QBasic. God. My mother tongue.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I'll never write such a game with C#. Even with the most powerful IDE,
the most wonderful editor, the most friendly graphics/gaming engines
right at my dispose, I simply won't.  Perhaps because I don't want, or
perhaps I simply can't. It's gone retro-style, and I could never hold
that mindset that I used 10+ years ago while casting spells from a
dialectal language in the C family. I still clearly remember. Back
then it was all that simple. Think, write, execute. With my current
toolchain, everything is tinted with the dark brown color of industry:
yeah you've got to use an IDE, otherwise you cannot get a clue about
the programming interface and their behaviour.  You've got to leave
your browser locked down in your main memory, because you will always
encounter a weird piece of hardware that is hard to talk with.
Dependencies.  To understand X, you must first understand Y. Then Z.
Then a chain. Then a tree.  Then a graph, where you get lost,
exhausted well before you even start to draw a circle on your screen.
</p>

<p>
Think, write, execute. A simple block of code that I use to display
my character. Then I need some variables for him. Health points. Inventory.
All I can think of, I write it down, somewhere in a very large BASIC file.
And at last I recall that there's another code block that put the
drawing logic of the current character into a buffer, then blitting
them onscreen.  Everything laid down linearly in a comprehensive way
just like the bare bone memory mapping scheme of any computer. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying that I don't like the current state of my mind. Rather
it's just an example. It's not that I become slow on C#. It's for game
making. I simply cannot implement (and as a consequence, think, due to
limited human memory) as fast as writing with BASIC like a sketchpad.
Of course, I would never write any distributed key value stores with
BASIC, for different but yet sensibly similar reasons.<br />
</p>

<p>
I wasn't not born for C#. Rather, for something I want to build.
So the problem hiding behind the question is now revealed. I'm stuck
with .Net's capabilities. Then I'll write a game like writing a web
server. Too bad. The reason is showing. I must jump out. Open my old
toolbox. Touch and feel my old companions. Seek for new borns, or
the polished, and extract the traits, the ideas, the stories behind.
