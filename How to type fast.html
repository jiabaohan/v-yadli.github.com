<p>
Yes, this one belongs to the computer knowledge tree.<br />
To type is easy, as long as you can press the keys. But to type fast,
it requires a lot of practice.<br />

<h2 id="toc_1.1">TODO</h2>

<p>
I'm thinking of creating a log of my speed practice. The speed
practice is divided into two parts, the first part is the mechanical
speed of the fingers, and the second half is the speed of thinking.
The later one if of very importance. The ideal case is that my brain
can be as fast as my fingers, but in most real applications, it can't
be. Practice needed.
